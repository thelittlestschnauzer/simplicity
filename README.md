Simplicity

Rails Portfolio Project - Simplicity - Personal Planner for busy Family

Motivation:

This Rails app was made to provide a family with a place to keep all appointments, lists, notes and meal planning. One place that everyone can check so everyone can be on the same page. With all four members of the family going in different directions I(Momma) needed one place for everyone to record their schedule/appointments.

Installation:

1. Fork and clone repository, and then within the main directory execute
    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:migrate

2. Run rails s or rails server

3. Open up new browser tab and navigate to: localhost:3000

4. Press ctrl+C when you want to exit out.

Version - Ruby 2.4.1 Rails 5.2.1 and tons of joyful hair pulling

Credits:

The inspiration was from the todomvc and I integrated simple_calendar gem to provide the calendar aspect for appointments. I started off with lists and then the app grew to appointments, notes and also dinner menu planning.
